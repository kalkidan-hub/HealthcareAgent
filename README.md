# Healthcare Agent

## Problem Statement

Hospitals struggle to provide timely, personalized care to patients due to overburdened staff and inefficient follow-up systems. This leads to missed appointments, delayed interventions, and poor patient outcomes. An AI-powered remote care agent is needed to automate patient engagement, analyze health data, and proactively coordinate careâ€”reducing costs, improving outcomes, and enhancing patient satisfaction.

This is a healthcare agent application built with FastAPI. The application provides various endpoints for managing lab reports, prescriptions, conversations, and sending emails. It also integrates with Twilio SendGrid for sending emails.

## Features

1. **Agentic Dynamic Patient Check-Up via Email**:
   - Automatically schedules and sends emails to patients based on their health status and risk factors.

2. **Risk Factor Extraction and Remediation**:
   - Extracts risk factors from patient's records and sends emails to patients with information and remediation steps.

3. **Electronic Health Records (EHR) for Doctors**:
   - Provides doctors with comprehensive EHRs of patients, including risk factors and prescriptions.

## Upcoming Features

1. **Chatbot for Patients**:
   - A chatbot that allows patients to interact with the healthcare assistant about their health status and other health-related queries.

2. **Appointment Scheduling with Doctors**:
   - Enables patients to schedule appointments with doctors directly through the platform.

3. **Demographical Health Status Reporting**:
   - Analyzes and reports on the health status of different demographics based on patients' EHRs.
